Breakout

A Javascript and Canvas based game created by Richard Burton for CIT190.

Game Purpose:
This is a standard breakout style game where the user must destroy all the blocks on screen.
This is done by moving the paddle left or right using either the arrow keys or the mouse and
bouncing the ball into the blocks. If the user misses deflecting the ball 3 times then the
game is over. If the  user succesfully destoys all the blocks on the screen, then they win!

Notes:
Currently the game is functioning stably and as intended but it is very simple so future 
releases could include things like: more than 1 level, color changing blocks, and blocks that
take more than 1 hit to destory.
