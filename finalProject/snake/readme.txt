Game Purpose:
This is a normal snake style game where the user tries to eat as many red blocks as possible, 
each one making the users snake longer. To control the movement of the snake, use the arrow 
keys.

Notes:
Currently the game is functioning stably and as intended. Future releases could include better 
graphics such as apples instead of red blocks.
