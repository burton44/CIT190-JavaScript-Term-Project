A Javascript and Canvas based game created by Richard Burton for CIT190.

Game Purpose:
This is a typical maze game where the user must navigate the black dot to the end of the maze, 
indicated by the light green dot. Use the arrow keys to move.

Notes:
Currently the game is functioning stably and as intended but it is very simple so future 
releases could include things like: a better back ground, items that you can pick, a 
score feature, or a time limit.
